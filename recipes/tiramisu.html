                    <li>¾ cup heavy cream, whipped to soft peaks</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>For Assembly:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>24-30 ladyfinger biscuits (savoiardi)</li>
                    <li>Unsweetened cocoa powder for dusting</li>
                    <li>Dark chocolate shavings (optional)</li>

            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prepare the Coffee Mixture:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Brew strong espresso or coffee and let it cool to room temperature. Mix in the coffee liqueur if using.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Make the Cream Filling:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>In a heatproof bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and sugar. Place the bowl over a pot of simmering water (double boiler) and whisk constantly until the mixture thickens and becomes pale, about 5-7 minutes. Remove from heat and let it cool slightly.</li>
                    <li>Fold the mascarpone cheese into the cooled egg mixture until smooth. Gently fold in the whipped cream until fully incorporated.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Assemble the Tiramisu:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Quickly dip each ladyfinger into the coffee mixture, being careful not to soak them too long to avoid sogginess.</li>
                    <li>Arrange a layer of coffee-dipped ladyfingers at the bottom of a 9x9-inch dish or a similar-sized serving dish.</li>
                    <li>Spread half of the mascarpone cream over the ladyfingers, smoothing it into an even layer.</li>
                    <li>Repeat with another layer of dipped ladyfingers and the remaining mascarpone cream.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Finish and Chill:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Cover the dish and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, preferably overnight, to allow the flavors to meld and the dessert to set.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Serve:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Just before serving, dust the top generously with cocoa powder and sprinkle with chocolate shavings if desired. Slice and serve chilled for a perfect ending to your meal. Enjoy!</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
