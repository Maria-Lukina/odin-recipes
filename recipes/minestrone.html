                <ul>
                    <li>In a large pot, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and cook until softened, about 3 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Add the carrots, celery, zucchini, bell pepper, and potato. Cook for another 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables begin to soften.</li>

                    <li>Add the diced tomatoes, vegetable broth, beans, basil, and oregano. Season with salt and pepper. Bring the soup to a boil, then reduce the heat and let it simmer for about 20 minutes, until the vegetables are tender.

                    </li>

            </li>
            <li><strong>Serve:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>
